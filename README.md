# Project Overview  
**Gamaim** is a platformer game that immerses players in different levels with unique backgrounds, sprites, and animations. The game aims to offer a fun and challenging experience by integrating interactive gameplay elements, engaging visuals, and dynamic sound effects.

# Current Status  
* ## What is Working:
  - **Game Engine Initialization**: The Kaboom.js framework is successfully set up, and basic configurations (like screen dimensions and letterboxing) are in place.
  - **Sprite Running**: The main player sprite is functional with basic animations such as idle, run, and jump.
  - **Movement and Controls**: The player can move left and right using the **arrow keys** or **WASD keys**, and jump using the **spacebar**.
  - **Fly Mode**: The player has the option to activate **fly mode** using the **F key** to move freely around the screen.
  - **Respawn**: The player can respawn after dying with the updated system in place.

* ## What is Planned:
  - **Level Design**: Interactive layouts using custom mappings and tile-based levels.
  - **Enemy Sprites**: Animated enemies with unique behaviors (e.g., spiders and birds).
  - **Power-Ups**: Items like coins, stars, and additional collectibles to enhance gameplay.
  - **Sound Effects**: Adding background music, sound effects for jumps, coin collection, and traps.
  - **Score System**: Implementing a scoring system to track player progress.

* ## Game Features:
  - Main Menu and Controls Menu.
  - Background music and sound effects.
  - End-game conditions, such as "Game Over" and "Victory."
